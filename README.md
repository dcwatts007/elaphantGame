# Overview

I created a web game that uses javascript and pixi js. It's currently a simple 2d platformer. 



# Development Environment

I used PIXIjs to implement the application in javascript.

# Future Work

I'm going to expand this into a full game, giving it more dangers(like enemies) and probably a side scrolling function.

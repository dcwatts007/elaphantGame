# Overview

I created a web game that uses javascript and pixi js. It's currently a simple 2d platformer. Here's the link: https://dcwatts007.github.io/elaphantGame/
Here's a video of it running: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8p-85m403Y

# Development Environment

I used PIXIjs to implement the application in javascript.

# Future Work

I'm going to expand this into a full game, giving it more dangers(like enemies) and probably a side scrolling function.
